# pimping Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X with openwrt

As i started with ibksturm.synology.me short after i realised, that my standart network hardware was to slow. so i buyed me a Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X (ER-X) (*1). But Preinstalled software was'n to use as i hade to do

Then i installed with a USB-Serial adapter cable, a windows TFTP Server and some manuals (*2) (*3) openwrt 18.01 (old Version)


Long storry, now it's running after 1.5 on Version 19.01 (*4) and it's still going. i think theres mutch more performance with openwrt than the original OS. 

I did also install some benefits like "kmod-tcp-bbr luci-app-bcp38" and pimp the sysctl.conf file
